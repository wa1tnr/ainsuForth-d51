New message: a out-of-band 'stash' (bypass git mechanism).




Old message follows:

Purpose of this 'portable' (ran out of fun words,
this is itt)

.. purpose is to preserve 'interesting' changes without
clobbering the existing, more structured BRANCH.

OLD Intent is to create another branch with the new stuff innit.

Progress: interesting oscilloscope work tonight.  Still do
not see output on the TX line (but the RX line does get
something very structured from PiUART).
