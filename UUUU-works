Working serial program.

Sends 'UUUUU' (forever) out PB16 (TX Feather M4 Express).

U is special: it's bit pattern is alternating 1's and 0's.

Lower case 'u' is similar with one bit changed.

UUU is a good test case as it only asks the programmer
to alternate the voltage levels at a fixed speed, and
to count them, and to shut off the alternating pattern
when it is complete.

With UUUU on the oscope, that means there's five pulses
embracing four gaps (hard to describe).  Pulses are
referenced at 3.3V, going to ground, so there's five
lower levels, four upper levels between them, and
upper levels surrounding both (leading and trailing
in much longer time intervals).
