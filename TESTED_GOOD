  Program outputs on the oscilloscope for D6 and for the RX line
  (when chars are sent from PiUARt).

  Look at 'u' vs 'U' (lower case 'u' typed on the keyboard that's
  piped through the PiUART to the Feather M4 Express TX/RX pair
  (okay, the RX port pin).

  The 'u' and 'U' are good as they show a regular pulse train, with
  just one difference between them.

  Set the scope time base to 25 uSec (57 KHz seems to be the data rate,
  according to the oscope's measure function).

  Further investigation showed the Frequency measured was about
  half the baud rate (38,400 bps shows as 19.14 KHz).

  So the 57 KHz exposes a 114,000 bps data channel (115,200 bps).

  Sometimes the scope measures half again (28.5 KHz where 57 KHz
  is expected).  Pressing 'u' vs 'U' unmasks this behavior.

  Looks like it's sampling using a best guess as to when data is
  being signaled (and screens out the quiet periods to get its
  frequency estimate).

  For this branch's present state of revision (working
  blinkie) -- the state of this branch in this repository is

        TESTED as GOOD    and is complete.

  Program is complete (build it stand-alone).

  Target is currently: Adafruit Feather M4 Express.
