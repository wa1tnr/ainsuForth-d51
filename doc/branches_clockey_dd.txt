On branch testing-clockey-dd

testing-clockey-dd is a new branch - going forward
it will focus on trying to use Jake Read's uart code.

&&

testing-clockey-aa  seems to have Jake Read's code
prominently in main.c and was probably what was
sought after, to reapproach the uart using Jake's
technique.
