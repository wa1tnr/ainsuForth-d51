scope trigger: pin D11 (PA21)

  PORT->Group[0].DIRCLR.reg  = (uint32_t)(1 << 21); // PA21 //  0 21 pinmode  // D11

  means 'direction clear' or 'direction zero' and direction means input or output mode

  in forth:  0 11 pinmode  // the 11 means D11 in arduino-based Forth
                           // Tue Aug  7 01:17:10 UTC 2018
                           // first correct use '11' for 'D11' - edit elsewhere to conform

      110 baud has   3.5 millisecond pulses (as seen on teh oscilloscope).

      300 baud has   3.5 millisecond pulses as well.

     1200 baud has   850   uSec pulses
     2400 baud has   429   uSec pulses
     4800 baud has   210   uSec pulses
     9600 baud has   105   uSec pulses
    19200 baud has    52   uSec pulses
    38400 baud has    27   uSec pulses

    57600 baud has    17.5 uSec pulses
   115200 baud has     8.6 usec pulses


   The binary patterns on the scope have left and right swapped,
   with the least significant bits to the left and MSB to the
   right.

   The 'u' vs 'U' pattern shift shows this (0x55 vs 0x75).

   111 0101   0x75
   101 0101   0x55 (read as one million, ten thousand, one hundred and one in decimal)

   Space (0x20) is 100 0000 in binary (read as 'one million' in decimal)

   That's all nonstandard (reading binary as if it were decimal) so don't learn that. ;)
