SAMD51 Atmel Start - no GPIO toggle seen

The code:

 [ https://github.com/wa1tnr/sandboxx.git ]

See subdirectory for Atmel Start.

Working on SAMD51 with Atmel Start.  GPIO toggle is inoperative -
cannot seem to blink D13 (PA23) for the Adafruit Feather M4 Express
target board (which runs Arduino IDE code just fine).

ORIGIN (in .ld Linker script) seems likely to be 0x4000 (SAMD21
has an ORIGIN of 0x2000).

The behavior of the SAMD51 target board, after an upload, indicates
the MCU's code execution does **not** go back to the bootloader
(does not return to a pattern of fading the red, D13 LED, on and off;
with a  steady green LED).

Behaves correctly (I think) so long as ORIGIN is set to 0x4000:

 $ /bin/pwd | cut -b 17-99
atst_51_aa_rev00c/gcc/gcc

 $ cat samd51j19a_flash_with_bootloader.ld | egrep ORIGIN

  rom      (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00004000, LENGTH = 0x00080000-0x4000
  ram      (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x00030000
  bkupram  (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x47000000, LENGTH = 0x00002000
  qspi     (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x04000000, LENGTH = 0x01000000


WORKING CODE on SAMD21
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Makefile (for SAMD21 - SAMD51 Makefile also) points to the Linker:

 $ /bin/pwd | cut -b 17-99
atst_aa_rev03a/gcc

 $ egrep \.ld Makefile | egrep lash
-T"../samd21a/gcc/gcc/samd21g18a_flash_with_bootloader.ld" \


ORIGIN for SAMD21 (unlike SAMD51) points to address 0x2000:

 $ /bin/pwd | cut -b 17-99
atst_aa_rev03a/samd21a/gcc/gcc

 $ cat samd21g18a_flash_with_bootloader.ld | egrep ORIGIN
  rom      (rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x00002000, LENGTH = 0x00040000-0x2000
  ram      (rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 0x00008000
 $ 


SAMD21 worked fine after changing the .ld script (Linker)
to account for the bootloader (offset 0x2000).

Thanks to Dean Miller's /seesaw/ for that .ld script!



SAMD51 INOPERATIVE for basic GPIO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tried two BOSSACs (Arduino likes the newer one). Tried futzing
with the clock configuration tool of Atmel Start.

Port pin MUX seems okay - PA23 (onboard monochrome red LED Feather
M4 Express) checks out in variant.* (as found in Arduino IDE code base)
as well as in the Feather M4 Express schematic.


Proven SAMD51 Hardware
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

SAMD51 hardware itself loads and runs my Forth (on the TX/RX UART
pair for Serial.print() statements via the CP2104 USB<==>UART
gateway chip).

I use the PiUART for this; very simple three wire interface,
including Ground).

So, I can validate the Feather M4 Express hardware in the 
Arduino IDE -- but cannot get a GPIO pin to toggle under the
Atmel Start generated code -- no pin toggle on D13 (PA23).

I can (and have) generated good Atmel Start code for SAMD21,
which does toggle GPIO pins easily.

I even have a working Dotstar driver I wrote (bit-banged) for
the Pimoroni Blinkt! 8x APA102 array!


Approaches
~~~~~~~~~~

  * BOSSAC command line arguments, versions
  * missing include files (compiles fine, but, yanno..)
  * Simplify code and remove legacy cruft not presently needed (the dotstar stuff)

END.
