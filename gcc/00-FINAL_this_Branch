On branch testing-clockey-dd-03-

This branch is closed to new development.  A copy
(a branch of this branch) has been made elsewhere
(see testing-clockey-ee-00-).

This program blinks the LED on D13 (if nothing else)
in its present form.

All then new dev was copied into ./portable.d and then
removed ('git checkout -- <file>' method, iterated).

It'll be reinstated in testing-clockey-ee-00- and
in this manner, some semblance of achievement for
testing-clockey-dd-03- is retained into the future.
