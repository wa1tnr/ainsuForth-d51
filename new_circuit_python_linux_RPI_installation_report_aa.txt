The Guide came up first-listed in the upper right hand
corner of learn-dot (on chromium-browser in RPi environ).

  1.  pip3 install RPI.GPIO - 13 seconds to complete this.
  2.  pip3 install adafruit-blinka - 26 seconds to complete.
  3.  python3 ./blinkatest.py
  PermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/dev/i2c-1'
  4.  $ ls -la /dev/i2c-1 
crw-rw---- 1 root i2c 89, 1 Apr 15 20:52 /dev/i2c-1
  5.  $ groups
nistoph sudo gpio
  6.  man useradd
  useradd is a low level utility for adding users. On Debian,
       administrators should usually use adduser(8) instead.
  7.  man adduser (bueno!)
  8.  sudo adduser nistoph i2c
[sudo] password for nistoph: 
Adding user `nistoph' to group `i2c' ...
Adding user nistoph to group i2c
Done.
  9.  groups # groups .. oops!
nistoph sudo gpio
 10.  exit
 11.  groups # Same error. - output omitted.
 12.  su - nistoph
Password: 
$ groups # bueno! 
nistoph sudo gpio i2c
 13.  (logout; login) also solves group i2c membership woes,
      here/now/after_that.
 14.  PAYLOAD

$ python3 ./blinkatest.py 
Hello blinka!
Digital IO ok!
I2C ok!
SPI ok!
done!

It's all good.

Note that this system was probably used for i2c with SeeSaw
earlier this year, so I didn't follow any other instructions,
and did everything in the regular GUI environment (X.org).
